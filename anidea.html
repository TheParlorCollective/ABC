        <p>Connecting Canvases to Artists</p>

        <div class="purpose">
            <h2>An Idea</h2>
            <p>The purpose of the Collective is to provide tattoo artists with a hub where they can share, cultivate and maintain their art portfolios and connect with potential clients. We wanted to ensure that The Collective we created was purely driven by the Artists and what they put into it.
            Thus allowing them the freedom to express themselves and design thier own space within their portfolio. Since most artists already advertise their work on social media platforms, The Collective was designed to centralize and provide a platform where the Canvases can find the Artist that 
            best suits there needs.
            <br>
            <br>Here at the collective we have three roles, <b>The Artist</b>, <b>The Canvas</b>, and <b>The Parlor</b>. 
            <br>
            <br><b>The Artist</b> is the core of the collective driving the content and creativity in the Collective. 
            <br><b>The Canvas</b> is the individual looking for the right artist to bring thier ideas to life. 
            <br><b>The Parlor</b> allows Tattoo Parlors to create a business profile and connect with artists and canvases alike.</p>
